# Data Loading Python Workshop

## Data Sources Students:   

  $ git clone https://github.com/georgetown-analytics/nba.git
  $ cd nba
  $ jupyter notebook

In Jupyter, open the file called "NBA Player Statistics Workshop.ipynb"

Given a dataset of NBA players performance and salary in 2014, you'll use Python to load the dataset and compute the summary statistics for the `SALARY` field:

- mean
- median
- mode
- minimum
- maximum

You will need to make use of the csv module or use pandas to load the data and interact with it. Computations should require only simple arithmetic.

**Bonus:**

Determine the relationship of PER (Player Efficiency Rating) to Salary via a visualization of the data.
